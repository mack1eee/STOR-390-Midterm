# STOR 390 Midterm Project: "Statistical Approaches for Assessing Disparate Impact in Fair Housing Cases" Methods and Normative Considerations

This repository hosts two files for my STOR 390 midterm project submission--a pdf and rmd file of my paper. 

In "Statistical Approaches for Assessing Disparate Impact in Fair Housing Cases", Dennis J. Aigner, Marco del √Ångel, & Joel Wiles examine and test three approaches to statistically proving disparate impact of a housing policy on a protected group. This paper explains their methodology and identifies normative considerations that arise relating to the topic at hand.
